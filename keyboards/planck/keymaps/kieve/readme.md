# Mostly The Default Planck Layout

I have added SOCD cleaning to WASD for fighting games on the QWERTY layer

SOCD which stands for Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Directions

What this means is when using a DPAD like input device, SOCD cleaning is required (by the rule FGC tourney rule sets, mainly the CPT as well as other majors) to convert the signals (the joystick portion) to do the following:

UP + DOWN = Up

LEFT + RIGHT = Neutral
